# Email Validator Api
This is a project file intended as a boilerplate for future APIs built with Python/Flask and hosted and monetized  through RapidApi. 

This particular example parses email addresses to check if the domain associated to it is a known temp / spam / five-minute-email domain. This can be useful to weed out spam submissions.
